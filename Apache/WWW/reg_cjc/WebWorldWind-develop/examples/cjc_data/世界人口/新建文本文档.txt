This map shows how many people live in different areas on Earth. The map is divided into numerous small boxes, called &quot;grids.&quot; Each grid box is about 1 kilometer long by one kilometer wide, and it is color coded to show how many people live there. Lighter areas have fewer people. The red dots scattered across most countries show cities, where many people live in a small area.
