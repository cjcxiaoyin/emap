Looking at Earth from outer space, clouds are easy to spot. Clouds are draped all around Earth like bright white decorations. Clouds are important to scientists because they reflect the Sun's light back to space and give shade to the surface. They also bring rain, which is important because all plants and animals need freshwater to live. These maps made from NASA satellite observations show how much of Earth's surface is covered by clouds for a given day, or over a span of days.
