When sunlight reaches the Earth&rsquo;s surface, some of it is absorbed and some is reflected. The relative amount (ratio) of light that a surface reflects compared to the total sunlight that falls on it is called <em>albedo</em>. Surfaces that reflect a lot of the light falling on them are bright, and they have a high albedo. Surfaces that don&rsquo;t reflect much light are dark, and they have a low albedo. Snow has a high a albedo, and forests have a low albedo.
