Rainfall is essential for life on Earth. Rain is a main source of fresh water for plants and animals. These maps show where and how much rain fell around the world on the dates shown. Notice that most rain falls near the equator. Notice also that more rain falls on the ocean than on land. The NASA instrument that made these rainfall measurements flies on a satellite orbiting our world near the equator, so it only measures rainfall near the equator and not at high latitudes, nor in Earth's polar regions.
