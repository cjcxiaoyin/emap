Light energy travels in waves, but not all the waves are the same. The kind of light our eyes can see is only a tiny part of the energy that exists in the universe. Other kinds of energy are invisible, like the energy that makes our hands feel warm when we hold them over a fire, or the energy that cooks our food in the microwave. When Earth absorbs sunlight, it heats up. The heat, or &quot;outgoing longwave radiation,&quot; radiates back into space. Satellites measure this radiation as it leaves the top of Earth&apos;s atmosphere. The hotter a place is, the more energy it radiates.
