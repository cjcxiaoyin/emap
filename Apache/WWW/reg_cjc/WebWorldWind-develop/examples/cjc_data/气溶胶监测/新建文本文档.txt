Tiny solid and liquid particles suspended in the atmosphere are called <em>aerosols</em>. These particles are important to scientists because they can affect climate, weather, and people's health. Some aerosols come from natural sources, such as dust, volcanic eruptions, and sea salts. Some aerosols are produced by humans, such as pollution from industries or automobiles, or smoke from fires. Using satellites scientists can tell whether a given plume of aerosols came from a natural source, or if is pollution produced by people. Two important clues about aerosols' sources are particle size and location of the plume. Natural aerosols (such as dust and sea salts) tend to be larger particles than man-made aerosols (such as smoke and industrial pollution).
