Maps help us understand where things are. Scientists use satellites to make maps of many different things on Earth to help them understand our world and how our world is changing. Judging by what the land surface looks like, scientists organized Earth into 17 different categories. Some examples of different types of land surface are cities, farm lands, forests, deserts, and so forth. Using satellite observations, scientists mapped where on Earth each of these 17 land surface categories can be found. The different colors on this map show the locations of each type of land surface. Scientists are monitoring how these land cover types change over time.
