Sea surface temperature is the temperature of the top millimeter of the ocean's surface. The average sea surface temperatures over a long period of time are called a sea surface temperature "climatology." An area's climatology acts a baseline for deciding whether and how much the climate is changing. To make a climatology data set, you average measurements collected over a long period of time. These data were collected between 1985 and 1997 by a series of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites. The observations are grouped into five-day periods.
